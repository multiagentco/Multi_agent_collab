 The provided Python code implements a simple calculator using a class-based approach. The `Calculator` class contains methods for basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The `calculator` function serves as an interface to these operations, taking in two numbers and an operation string.

## Calculator Class
The `Calculator` class encapsulates the arithmetic operations. Each method within this class corresponds to a specific operation.

### Methods
- `add(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
- `subtract(a, b)`: Returns the difference between `a` and `b`.
- `multiply(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
- `divide(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`. Raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `b` is zero.

## Calculator Function
The `calculator(a, b, operation)` function is a convenient interface to the `Calculator` class methods. It takes two numbers `a` and `b`, and an `operation` string indicating the operation to perform. It returns the result of the specified operation on `a` and `b`.

### Operations Supported
- 'add': Addition
- 'subtract': Subtraction
- 'multiply': Multiplication
- 'divide': Division

### Example Usage
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(calculator(10, 2, 'add'))  # Output: 12
    print(calculator(10, 2, 'subtract'))  # Output: 8
    print(calculator(10, 2, 'multiply'))  # Output: 20
    print(calculator(10, 2, 'divide'))  # Output: 5.0
```

## Documentation for Deployment
For deployment purposes, ensure that the `Calculator` class and the `calculator` function are properly documented. The provided docstrings within the methods and the function serve as a good starting point. Consider using a documentation generator like Sphinx to create comprehensive documentation for your Python code.
