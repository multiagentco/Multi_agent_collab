 The Python code implements a simple calculator with four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The `calculator` function takes three arguments: two numbers (`a` and `b`) and an `operation` to be performed. It returns the result of the specified operation on the two numbers or an error message if the operation is invalid or if division by zero is attempted. The `main` function gets two numbers and an operation from the user, calls the `calculator` function, and prints the result. 

To use this code, simply run it and follow the prompts to enter the numbers and the operation you want to perform. The code is well-structured, readable, and includes input validation for the operation and division by zero.

Here is a sample documentation for the `calculator` function:
```python
def calculator(a: float, b: float, operation: str) -> float:
    """
    Performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.

    Args:
        a (float): The first number.
        b (float): The second number.
        operation (str): The operation to be performed. Can be 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', or 'divide'.

    Returns:
        float: The result of the operation.
    """
    # function implementation
```
And here is a sample documentation for the `main` function:
```python
def main() -> None:
    """
    Gets two numbers and an operation from the user, calls the calculator function, and prints the result.
    """
    # function implementation
```
